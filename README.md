# Web Scraping Project : Book Data Analysis 
 [Interactive Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDg3OTQwNmYtYTRjMS00M2E4LWI5MGQtZGYzMDdhOWQ3ZjVhIiwidCI6IjkyZGI5MDhjLWFjZGItNGEwOC1iOTdhLWZiYjE1NjI2NDY1MiJ9)


## About
This Python project is all about gathering useful details from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/index.html) website. I've collected information like Category, Name, Rating, Price, and Image URL for 1000 different products. To make things interesting, I've stored this data in a CSV file and used it to create an interactive Power BI report.With the Power BI report, you can filter and play around with the data. It's like turning a big list of books into a fun and interactive report for checking out different categories, ratings, and more. It's basically a  way to play with book data.


The Colab notebook, all the necessary [Python Code](https://github.com/Zeba-Kauser/Web-Scraping_Project/blob/main/final.ipynb) are provided for web scraping. [Data Source](https://github.com/Zeba-Kauser/Web-Scraping_Project/blob/main/All_products.csv)
